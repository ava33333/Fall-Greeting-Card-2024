This project displays a fall greeting card with two pumpkins in an 
external window. The user is prompted to click the screen to make
the pumpkins "flicker". Once the flickering is done, the user is 
prompted to click the screen again to end the program.

To run the project, you must install the python graphics libary.
Here is the link for that:
https://pypi.org/project/graphics.py/ .
Once you install the library, you have to make sure that the file for
the Fall Greeting Card code is in the same folder as the graphics libary
so that it can be properly accessed.
